infinite-jump:
  name: Infinite Jump
  description: |
    Variation of [[abi:secondary-jumps]], gives the protagonist the ability to jump in mid-air indefinitely.
  variants:
   - Pause/stopp when protagonist is damaged, making it possible to restart the sequence only after landing.

wall-jump:
  name: Wall Jump
  description: |
    Allows jumping off the wall in mid-air.
  variants:

    - Allow climbing a vertical column indefinitely.
    - Limit to a single wall-jump between landings.

    A generic container for all the other types of jumps which can occur under very special circumstances which do not warrant a separate entry for each jump.
  variants:
