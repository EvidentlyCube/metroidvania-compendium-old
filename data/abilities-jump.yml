infinite-jump:
  name: Infinite Jump
  description: |
    Variation of [[abi:secondary-jumps]], gives the protagonist the ability to jump in mid-air indefinitely.
  variants:
   - Pause/stopp when protagonist is damaged, making it possible to restart the sequence only after landing.

wall-jump:
  name: Wall Jump
  description: |
    Allows jumping off the wall in mid-air.
  variants:
    - May disallow climbing a single column by pushing the protagonist far away from the wall on jump that they get back to the wall a little lower than where they jumped from.
    - May only allow jumping off specific types of walls/disallow jumping off specific types of walls.
    - May allow climbing a vertical column indefinitely.
    - May be limited to a single wall-jump between landings.
    - May completely disallow returning back to the wall that was jumped off by forcing inertial movement until landing (makes it really hard to aim).
