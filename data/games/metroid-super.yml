    #### Description:
    A side-scroller platformer shooter.

    #### Analysis:
    Super Metroid is often hailed as the best metroid and the best in the metroidvania genre. But there is one very specific aspect that ensured this game is still played to the death - sequence breaking. Where [[game:metroid-zero]] seems like it was engineered with sequence breaks in mind Super Metroid feels organic, as if they were not the intentions of the devs (which might as well be true, there are people who claim both) which also translated to many more ways to break the game. Low percent completion? [Check].(http://deanyd.net/sm/index.php?title=14%25) Reverse boss order? [Check].(http://deanyd.net/sm/index.php?title=Reverse_Boss_Order) Skip bosses? [Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoUEX6wVRF0) and [check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3t8TIIj7IM).

    Super Metroid is the to-go game to experience brilliant level design both in terms of fun factor for regular players and exploitability by pros.
