    #### Description:
    A side-scroller platformer shooter.

    #### Analysis:
    Being the first or one of the first games that we can categorize as metroidvanias Metroid is responsible for a lot of things we take for granted today - open exploration of the world, collecting power-ups to enable new routes, backtracking or hunting for hidden power-ups. The strong core of the game has been subsequently reused and improved upon both in further installments and in other games which renders the original devoid of any especially intriguing characteristics, but not fully.

     All the technological limitations of the era and the platform create something to explore, though from the point of view of contemporary game design it's of little interest as most of the decisions made around those limitations is not very interesting to explore nowadays.

     But there is one very interesting concept in this game that could make a comeback in a modern game, even if in Metroid it served very little purpose - limiting the beam to a single power-up. A careful routing could create an interesting puzzle for the player to solve, though it's **very** important to avoid excessive amounts of backtracking in such a case. Skipping item aquisition fanfare would also be a wise choice.
