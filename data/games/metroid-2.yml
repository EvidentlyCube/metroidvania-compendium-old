    #### Description:
    A side-scroller platformer shooter.

    #### Analysis:
    For many Metroid II is the black horse of the family, despite in almost every aspect being superior to its predecessor. Many parallels could be drawn to even more infamous [Zelda II: The Adventure of Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link), though it wasn't as drastic of a change. However Metroid II is a very interesting piece to study when placed in the context of the other 2D metroid titles.

    The game features almost complete departure from traditional "bosses" found in majority of games. Instead the player fights the same minibosses multiple times in different environments which is a two-edged sword, more intensely boring the player but at the same time allows them to experience how the context shapes the seemingly identical encounters. It could've been additionally improved by allowing a combat with multiple metroids of the same of different types at the same time but most likely due to the technical limitations this wasn't done - such a move would've certainly increased the fun of the game.

    There is also the problem known from the first game, an abundance of identical passages and chambers. This only gets worse by the fact that the locations do not exactly belong in a flat or sensible space - plotting the map onto paper results in rooms overlapping each other or being longer/shorter/bigger/smaller depending on which route you take. Both of those things are huge issues.
