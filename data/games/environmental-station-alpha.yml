    #### Description:
    A metroidvania platformer shooter about a robot dispatched to explore a space station which served as a preserve for unique lifeforms and environments. The game features a very lo-res art style.

    #### Analysis:
    The main features of ESA are solid gameplay, a large quantity of bosses and vast amount of metapuzzles which can probably take certain players about as much time as finishing the game the normal way. Not many things can be said about this game's design because there aren't really any extraordinary things that would make it exceptionally unique, which in no way means it's a bad game - to the contrary, the gameplay is very solid and well polished.
