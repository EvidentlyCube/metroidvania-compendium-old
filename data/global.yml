  ## [What is Metroidvania](#what-is-metroidvania)

  > Metroidvania games generally feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, though access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other portals that can only be opened after the player has acquired special items, tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements can also aid the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map.

  > Your typical Metroidvania game is typically portrayed as a single large area or a set of large areas, broken up into many different rooms, corridors, and open spaces, with [Respawning Enemies](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies "Warning: TV Tropes Link!") in most areas. Progress in the game is driven by the discovery of [Video Game Tools](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTools "Warning: TV Tropes Link!") (actions, abilities, inventory items) that allow the player to navigate obstacles and "unlock" new areas, while also serving as more than just a "key"; for example, a weapon powerful enough to destroy certain walls will often deal more damage to enemies, and the ability to climb walls could be used to avoid enemies as well as reach high places. The player will often pass many insurmountable obstacles as they explore the game, which they must [backtrack](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking "Warning: TV Tropes Link!") to after finding the appropriate item/ability, often made easier by opening [Doors To Before](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore "Warning: TV Tropes Link!").
