<p>Metroidvania games generally feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, though access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other portals that can only be opened after the player has acquired special items, tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements can also aid the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map.</p>
<p>Source <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your typical Metroidvania game is typically portrayed as a single large area or a set of large areas, broken up into many different rooms, corridors, and open spaces, with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="Warning: TV Tropes Link!">Respawning Enemies</a> in most areas. Progress in the game is driven by the discovery of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTools" title="Warning: TV Tropes Link!">Video Game Tools</a> (actions, abilities, inventory items) that allow the player to navigate obstacles and &quot;unlock&quot; new areas, while also serving as more than just a &quot;key&quot;; for example, a weapon powerful enough to destroy certain walls will often deal more damage to enemies, and the ability to climb walls could be used to avoid enemies as well as reach high places. The player will often pass many insurmountable obstacles as they explore the game, which they must <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking" title="Warning: TV Tropes Link!">backtrack</a> to after finding the appropriate item/ability, often made easier by opening <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore" title="Warning: TV Tropes Link!">Doors To Before</a>.</p>

<p>A side-scroller platformer shooter.</p>
<h4><span id="analysis" class="anchor"></span>Analysis:</h4>
<p>Being the first or one of the first games that we can categorize as metroidvanias Metroid is responsible for a lot of things we take for granted today - open exploration of the world, collecting power-ups to enable new routes, backtracking or hunting for hidden power-ups. The strong core of the game has been subsequently reused and improved upon both in further installments and in other games which renders the original devoid of any especially intriguing characteristics, but not fully.</p>
<p>All the technological limitations of the era and the platform create something to explore, though from the point of view of contemporary game design it's of little interest as most of the decisions made around those limitations is not very interesting to explore nowadays.</p>
<p>But there is one very interesting concept in this game that could make a comeback in a modern game, even if in Metroid it served very little purpose - limiting the beam to a single power-up. A careful routing could create an interesting puzzle for the player to solve, though it's <strong>very</strong> important to avoid excessive amounts of backtracking in such a case. Skipping item aquisition fanfare would also be a wise choice.</p>

<p>A side-scroller platformer shooter.</p>
<h4><span id="analysisNaN" class="anchor"></span>Analysis:</h4>
<p>For many Metroid II is the black horse of the family, despite in almost every aspect being superior to its predecessor. Many parallels could be drawn to even more infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a>, though it wasn't as drastic of a change. However Metroid II is a very interesting piece to study when placed in the context of the other 2D metroid titles.</p>
<p>The game features almost complete departure from traditional &quot;bosses&quot; found in majority of games. Instead the player fights the same minibosses multiple times in different environments which is a two-edged sword, more intensely boring the player but at the same time allows them to experience how the context shapes the seemingly identical encounters. It could've been additionally improved by allowing a combat with multiple metroids of the same of different types at the same time but most likely due to the technical limitations this wasn't done - such a move would've certainly increased the fun of the game.</p>
<p>There is also the problem known from the first game, an abundance of identical passages and chambers. This only gets worse by the fact that the locations do not exactly belong in a flat or sensible space - plotting the map onto paper results in rooms overlapping each other or being longer/shorter/bigger/smaller depending on which route you take. Both of those things are huge issues.</p>

<p>Super Metroid is often hailed as the best metroid and the best in the metroidvania genre. But there is one very specific aspect that ensured this game is still played to the death - sequence breaking. Where <a href="#game-metroid-zero" title="Go to game: Metroid Zero Mission">Metroid Zero Mission</a> seems like it was engineered with sequence breaks in mind Super Metroid feels organic, as if they were not the intentions of the devs (which might as well be true, there are people who claim both) which also translated to many more ways to break the game.

<p>A side-scroller platformer shooter.</p>
<h4><span id="analysis" class="anchor"></span>Analysis:</h4>
<p>Metroid: Zero Mission is a complete reimagination of the original metroid - it's technically a remake but it improves on every single aspect of the original. It's a very polished game and in terms of game design there are a few areas which are have to be explored further:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The whole stealth section which is an elaborate <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="Warning: TV Tropes Link!">mini-game</a> yet at the same time is almost perfectly within the boundaries set by the main game - the player executes the same gameplay routines (traversing dangerous terrain and shooting at enemies) but the changed context and slight mechanics alterations make it into a very different game. There are only really two big accusations that can be made: the first enemy you encounter can't be fathomably avoided without raining an alarm; the sequence is a bit too long and repetetive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By looking at the sequence breaks in the game it is very clear the game was consciously designed with them in mind (as opposed to Super Metroid which has a comparable amount of sequence breaks but it's arguable whether they were intended or not). Whether that's better than unintentional sequence breaks is a matter of discussion, but the less hardcore players will certainly appreciate the fact that they can't get (semi-)stuck by accidentally doing things out of order.</p>

                    <h4><span id="descriptionNaN" class="anchor"></span>Description:</h4>
<p>A metroidvania platformer shooter about a robot dispatched to explore a space station which served as a preserve for unique lifeforms and environments. The game features a very lo-res art style.</p>
<h4><span id="analysisNaN" class="anchor"></span>Analysis:</h4>
<p>The main features of ESA are solid gameplay, a large quantity of bosses and vast amount of metapuzzles which can probably take certain players about as much time as finishing the game the normal way. Not many things can be said about this game's design because there aren't really any extraordinary things that would make it exceptionally unique, which in no way means it's a bad game - to the contrary, the gameplay is very solid and well polished. But where this game shines the most is the numerous boss encounters and the massive meta-puzzle.</p>
